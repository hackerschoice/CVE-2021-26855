# CVE-2021-26855
PoC of proxylogon chain SSRF(CVE-2021-26855) to write file by testanull, censored by github

Why does github remove this exploit because it is against the acceptable use policy -
but tons of other proof of concept exploits and frameworks are OK?
* [https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)
* [Lots of CVE exploit repositories](https://github.com/search?q=CVE&type=repositories)

Is it because Github is owned by Microsoft?

Censoring exploits is bad for security, even if an individual exploit sometimes
can put companies at risk which should have already fixed their systems.
And Github puts up a bad precedence.
